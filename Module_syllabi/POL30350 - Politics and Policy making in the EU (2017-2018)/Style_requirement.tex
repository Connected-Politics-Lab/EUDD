\subsection*{Footnotes and References}

	Detailed and complete referencing in your assignment is \textbf{ESSENTIAL}. You are free to choose the referencing style that you prefer, but it must be applied consistently and in line with official style guidelines. If you are in any confusion about how to correctly approach referencing and bibliography issues, there are many good guides available online (Here for instance: \url{http://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/Guide69.pdf}).
